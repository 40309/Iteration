##Question 3

A book lending library lends books to borrowers. Each borrower is assigned a unique borrower code. This code is encoded magnetically on to an identity card issued to each borrower when they join the library. The code is read from the identity card by swiping it through a machine connected to the libraryâ€™s computer system. The code is also printed on the card in human-readable form.

Each book is allocated a unique book code. The book code together with other details are pasted on to the inside cover of the book as shown below. When a borrower borrows a book the book code is scanned into the computer system so that the loan can be recorded.
